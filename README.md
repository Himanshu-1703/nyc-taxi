# NYC-Taxi

==============================

Machine Learning project to predict trip duration for taxis in NYC

## Important

This code will give error until the project is installed as a package in the environment that has all the dependencies for the project.

After creation of environment and installation of all required packages using pip run this command in the command terminal.

```cmd
pip install -e .
```

| This will fix all the import statement errors such as `ModuleNotFoundError` when recreating pipelines using command

```cmd
dvc repro
```

## CI/CD through GitHub Actions

The CI/CD workflow will throw an error while creating the CML report because no Personal Access Token is linked to the repository for safety purposes.

I advice the user to generate his/her own access token as explained in the Session-5 and run this code in their own repository and it will work without any errors.

> Thanks everyone for following the content with dedication and patience.👏
